Liri-Node-App
Liri Bot searches for a song, movie, or a particular bands tour dates using Node.js. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in specific parameters and gives you back different types of data.

How the app works
The app Liri works by on the command line off of Node.js. These are the phrases that are used to invoke LIRI: -node liri.js for searching for any movie info using omdb api, -node liri.js to get info on song using Node Spotify API npm package and finally -node liri.js <band/artist name> to get the dates and venues of music concerts of your chosen artist or band.

# LIRI-Bot


## Liri-Bot-Application
This app is going to search for a song, movie and a band's schedules using Node.js. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How the app works
The app Liri works by on the command line off of Node.js. These are the phrases that are used to invoke LIRI: -node liri.js for searching for any movie info using omdb api, -node liri.js to get info on song using Node Spotify API npm package and finally -node liri.js <band/artist name> to get the dates and venues of music concerts of your chosen artist or band.
